<h1> Why hospital prices need watching: </br>
    the compelling case for transparency. </h1>

<h3> </br> Steven Brill spent seven months analyzing hundreds of bills from hospitals, doctors, drug companies and medical equipment manufacturers to find out why Americans are paying so much for health care. What he discovered, outlined in detail in his story <em><a href = http://content.time.com/time/subscriber/article/0,33009,2136864,00.html> Bitter Pill: Why Medical Bills Are Killing Us </a> </em> (<em>TIME Magazine</em>, Special Edition, March 3, 2013), radically changed the way many Americans think about our medical institutions. Here is what Brill concludes: </br></br>

"The health care market is not a market at all. It's a crapshoot. Everyone fares differently based on circumstances they can neither control nor predict. They may have no insurance. They may have insurance, but their employer chooses their insurance plan and it may have a payout limit or not cover a drug or treatment they need. They may or may not be old enough to be on Medicare or, given the different standards of the 50 states, be poor enough to be on Medicaid. If they're not protected by Medicare or protected only partially by private insurance with high co-pays, they have little visibility into pricing, let alone control of it. </br> </br>
 
"People have little choice of hospitals or the services they are billed for, even if they somehow knew the prices before they got billed for the services. They have no idea what their bills mean, and those who maintain the chargemasters couldn't explain them if they wanted to. How much of the bills they end up paying may depend on the generosity of the hospital or on whether they happen to get the help of a billing advocate. They have no choice of the drugs that they have to buy or the lab tests or CT scans that they have to get, and they would not know what to do if they did have a choice. They are powerless buyers in a sellers' market where the only consistent fact is the profit of the sellers." </br></br>
