Hospital Watch
======================

Tech Bootcamp 2014 finalists were invited to an "Introduction to Coding" seminar, taught some HTML5/CSS, and asked to build a basic website for an idea they believe could make an impact and want to realize. "Hospital Watch" is a service that will take publically available financial and price data from hospitals and makes it easy for patients to access, use and understand. The availability of this information will support more informed decision-making, greater fairness, and more competition in a time when the health care system is asked to do more with less.
